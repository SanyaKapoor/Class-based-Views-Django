This is a basic implementation of the generic class based list views and generic date archive view. The code snippets for the above two classes that had to be used were:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/class-based-views/generic-date-based/#dayarchiveview
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#listview

Follow the steps below to view the project:

 Make sure you have python3 installed on your machine
 Open the zip file in an editor
 
 Using the inbuilt terminal run the following commands: (Or navigate to the project directly to use terminal)

 python3.6 -m venv my_env
 source my_env/bin/activate
 pip install django
 python mange.py makemigrations
 python manage.py migrate
 python manage.py createsuperuser (This will give you access to localhost:8000/admin - through which you would be required to add data to the application)
 python manage.py runserver localhost:8000

 Go to localhost:8000/admin on your browser and login with the details you entered on the above step. You can add a few articles and then test:

 localhost:8000/article-list/ - To see all the articles
 localhost:8000/2020/jun/18/ - To see the day archive view

Project structure:
'list' & 'dayArchiveView' implement the above two classes respectively. For the sake of convenience, dayArchiveView uses the model used in list so that the admin has to enter article details just once and both classes will be impelmented on the same data.
